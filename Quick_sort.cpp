//Quick sort (binary-algo)	
//	   |
//   non-liner algo
//    (Pivot element -> two  pointer(low value and high value)
//    recursion also used for formula


//rule
//In a Quick shot we have to keep in mind afollowing conidition
 
// select the pivot element
// now choose left and right pointer (low and hogh value)

//the left pointer will stop if the value of it greater then pivot element
//otherwise it will move on 

//(if l > pivot)
//  Stop
//else(
//continue (L++)
//)




//(if R < pivot)
//  Stop
//else(
//continue (R--)
//)


//if both pointer get stopped the value of Left and Right will be sweaped if they did Cross each other
//otherwise the value of are will be sweaped with pivot element
//and the tree will divided into two part, We will follow the recusion till we get single element.
